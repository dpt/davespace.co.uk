TODO

- use blog fragments on the main index page
  - ie. splitting at <!-- more --> markers

- need a page squishing pass
  - get back old scripts for page compression?

- tip jar / begging

- ideas for content:
    - drawings / doodles
    - icons i drew on RO
    - old apps
    - bring back Tristone content
    - stick figures


DONE

- populate the 'tags' bit on the main index page
  - possible within gostatic, or will it need some python?

- stop fractions appearing in markdown output [built custom gostatic binary]

- syntax highlighting - use pygments
  - return to ARM highlighter [just re-used old one converted to python and integrated into highlightsyntax.py]

- navigation for the arm courses
  - dropdown rather than flippers or what?
  - [done] simple text next/prev flippers

- 'recent posts'
  - sorted list on the main index page [done, but check sorting]

- large scale slides
  - [abandoned], didn't look right: content would need re-formatting for the 'smaller' amount of space

- reset.css
  - needed?

- remove/abandon adverts

- tags in nav bar ordered correctly?
  - need to check that these are in a sensible order. they don't look alphabetic to me.

- ive made the arm pages use # ## and ### for headings but the other pages still have to use ### #### 
  - need to wrap the other pages in section tags
  - [done] i think

- ensure page icons are consistent
  - photofiler => camera, privateeye => search, etc.

- add google analytics meta header

- make all images a multiple of 20px high
  [tried, gave up]

- re-link up the large versions of images
  [later, maybe]

- sync motionmasks page with github version of the same

- need an index for the ARM courses
  - tags page alone is not sufficient
