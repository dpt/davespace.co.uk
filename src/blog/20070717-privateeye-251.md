PrivateEye 2.50 had a bug which could stop the effects window working on any OS earlier than RISC OS 4. I was calling `Wimp_AutoScroll` which didnâ€™t exist up until WindowManager 4.00.

Bug fix release 2.51, now available, fixes the problem and also tidies up some vanishing icons in the templates.
