PrivateEye is a viewer for Sprites, DrawFiles, JPEGs, ArtWorks, GIFs and PNGs. It also has editing features including bitmap effects and rotation.

Version 3.10 is an update which enhances its handling of JPEGs:

* Progressive JPEGs are now passed straight through to the OS when it is capable of decoding them. This requires RISC OS Select with SpriteExtend 1.30 [circa 2002] or RISC OS 5 with SpriteExtend 1.73 [circa 2016], or later. You can still force JPEG cleaning on from the choices if you wish.
* The information given on JPEGs is enhanced. The source info window [pictured above] will show the details of the file format, being JFIF, Exif, Adobe or a combination thereof; Baseline, Extended Sequential or Progressive DCT coding and whether the packing was Huffman or Arithmetic.
* Hand-in-hand with the above is enhanced colourspace reporting. The "Colours" field will show whether the JPEG is encoded as YCbCr (the most common), YCCK (like CMYK), RGB or CMYK. It will report the number of components used, and the depth of those components too.

And in addition to those tasty JPEG goodies:

* Multiple effect windows may now be open concurrently.
* PrivateEye is now cross-compiled using GCCSDK.
* It is now supplied as a RiscPkg package.

PrivateEye is freeware.
