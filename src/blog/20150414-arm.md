There have been a couple of recent fixes to the ARM courses. Here's a summary (with reporter in brackets):

* [Introduction to ARM > Registers](/arm/introduction-to-arm/registers.html)
  * The 'aliases' diagram was wrong: corrected. (Felix Dreissig)
* [Efficient C for ARM > Sentinels](/arm/efficient-c-for-arm/sentinels.html)
  * The 'pipelined' Wikipedia link was broken. (Marek Niepiek≈Ço, Matt Godbolt)

In fact, while fixing the aliases diagram I re-drew all of the Introduction to ARM diagrams in [Affinity Designer](https://affinity.serif.com/en-gb/).
