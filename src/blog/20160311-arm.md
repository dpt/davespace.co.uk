There have been a couple of recent changes to the ARM courses. Here's a summary (with reporter in brackets):

* [Introduction to ARM > Barrel Shifter](/arm/introduction-to-arm/barrel-shifter.html)
  * The 'ASR' diagram was wrong: corrected. (Bruce Robertson)
* The Introduction to ARM diagrams have all had 2x and 3x scale versions added for the benefit of those using retina/HiDPI screens.
