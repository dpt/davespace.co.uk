<!-- begin summary -->

If you have a faithful Acorn Risc&nbsp;PC kicking around you might have found that the rubber feet on the bottom of the case have started to crumble, like mine:

In some cases the rubber feet can even liquefy and leave you with a wonky computer sitting in a pool of grey goo.

You'll be pleased to know that you can lever off the old ones and replace them with a new set of _Bumpons_ (that's what they're called) from 3M.

The specific ones you want are **3M Bumpon SJ5023** in grey. They're 20.5mmÂ² wide by 7.6mm high. The [datasheet is here](https://multimedia.3m.com/mws/media/117314O/3m-bumpon-protective-products-molded-shapes-colored-and-clear.pdf). I bought my replacements [from this eBay seller](https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/12-Grey-Rubber-Feet-3M-Bumpon-SJ5023-20-6-x-20-6x7-6mm-Self-adhesive-sticky/113640833094). Note that the greys seem harder to find than the black and clear variants.

Once you have your replacements, start removing the broken feet. Wiggle a blunt knife in at the corner closest the edge and push up.

This is made easier since the holes for the case locking pins go right through the case and leave a void under the foot, so the bumpon's flat base never entirely adheres to the full square.

Once removed, clean the old glue off using some isopropyl alcohol. I used a toothpick too for the harder gunk.

Then you can peel off the new feet/bumpons/tapered squares/_trapezoidal prisms_ from their backing paper and fit them:
