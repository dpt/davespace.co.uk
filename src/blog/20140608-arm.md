There have been some recent fixes to the ARM course pages. Here's a summary with (reporter in brackets):

* [Introduction to ARM > Movement](/arm/introduction-to-arm/movement.html)
  * `MVN` ought to be described as "move NOT" rather than "move negated". (Dan Lewis)
* [Introduction to ARM > Conditional Execution](/arm/introduction-to-arm/conditional.html)
  * The entry for the "LE" condition code showed the wrong binary encoding. Also, the flags were getting mangled due to Markdown coopting the | character. (Michael Vartan)
  * In the "set the flags, then use various condition codes" example, the less-than comparison ought to have been less-than-or-equal. (Justin Davinroy)
* [Efficient C for ARM > Sentinels](/arm/efficient-c-for-arm/sentinels.html)
  * The "replacing array indexing with pointers" link was broken. (Marek NiepiekÅ‚o)
* Fixed broken links on [Efficient C for ARM > Pointer Aliasing](/arm/efficient-c-for-arm/aliasing.html), [Efficient C for ARM > Function Argument Types](/arm/efficient-c-for-arm/funcarg.html) and both index pages.
