<!-- begin summary -->

[PrivateEye](/risc.os/privateeye.html) 3.14 is now available.

[![Peter Default](/software/thumbs/eyesnap6.png)](/software/eyesnap6.png)

PrivateEye is a viewer for Sprites, DrawFiles, JPEGs, ArtWorks, GIFs and PNGs. It also has editing features including bitmap effects and rotation.

Version 3.14 is a minor update with a selection of tweaks and bug fixes:

* When loading new images the "Fit to screen" mode will now only ever scale downwards. This is more helpful than the previous behaviour which would scale small images up to needlessly enormous proportions. Note that the "Fit screen" button on the scale view dialogue is unaffected.
* The data transfer system has had an upgrade:
  * An app-to-app transfer won't result in `<Wimp$Scrap>` used in title bars now. It'll use `<untitled>` in title bars, and `ImageFile` when saving an image with no known name. Received files are marked as modified too. This matches the behaviour of standard RISC OS apps.
  * Message_DataOpen template mode (when `est_size` is -2) is supported (it's not super useful because PrivateEye's not a full editor, but it is in there).
* libpng has been upgraded to 1.6.37.

<!-- end summary -->

* Fix: The GIF loader would crash if fed bad data.
* Fix: The PNG loader had memory leaks on the failure path.
* Fix: The rotate window thumbnail could have excessive black borders. I've made a small effort to make the scaling more accurate but note that, if enabled, Tinct has accuracy issues when downscaling that do cause a black border.
* Fix: When you adjust click to close a modified viewer window, the directory display that's opened will now pop up only after the viewer is gone rather than obscuring the discard/cancel/save dialogue.
* Fix: The effects window scroll list selection highlight now moves along with the dragged item.
* Fix: The expand dynamic range effect no longer crashes when there's only two colours in the image.
* Special bonus fix: Reduced !RunImage by 50K. WimpSlot reduced to 480K.
