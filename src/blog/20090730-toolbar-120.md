After a mere decade’s hiatus here’s [Toolbar](../risc.os/toolbar.html) 1.20 with a few tweaks.

* The toolbar now opens and closes independently of desktop speed. So if a greedy process is hogging your desktop, the toolbar will now unfurl and retract in the same amount of time.
* You can have multiple toolbars, if you fire off multiple instances (it’ll use different choices files and position itself independently).
* The `!RunImage` is no longer squashed.
