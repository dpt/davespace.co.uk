After a mere **decade’s** hiatus here’s [Toolbar](../risc.os/toolbar.html) 1.20 with a few tweaks.

[Toolbar earlier today](../software/toolsnap1.png)

* The toolbar now opens and closes independently of desktop speed. If a greedy task is hogging your desktop the toolbar will now unfurl and retract in the same amount of time.
* You can have multiple toolbars. If you fire up multiple instances it’ll use different choices files and position itself independently.
* The `!RunImage` is no longer squashed so you can hack it.
