Geminus, the Iyonix graphics accelerator, has been re-released as a [free download](http://adrianl.drobe.co.uk/geminus.html). Its sprite caching provides a substantial speedup for [PhotoFiler](/risc.os/photofiler.html) and its JPEG acceleration greatly benefits [PrivateEye](/risc.os/privateeye.html).
