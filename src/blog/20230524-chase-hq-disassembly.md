<!-- begin summary -->

It's been ten years since I started [reverse engineering The Great Escape](/the.great.escape/). I didn't really intend to start another disassembly project but after trying out SkoolKit's new [tape loading and Z80 simulation](https://skoolkit.ca/posts/2023/02/loads-more-simulation/) magic I found myself with a new one on my hands. This time I'm [pulling apart the Spectrum version of Chase H.Q.](https://github.com/dpt/ChaseHQ)!

Here's the current state of the disassembly: https://dpt.github.io/ChaseHQ/ and the related thread on Spectrum Computing: https://spectrumcomputing.co.uk/forums/viewtopic.php?p=117562#p117562

See you in ten years!

Okay, not really, because now we have an amazing new tool to accelerate the process: [Spectrum Analyser](https://colourclash.co.uk/spectrum-analyser/) is an emulator-debugger-interactive-disassembler combo. Here's a short, silent, video of me using it to watch Chase H.Q.'s internal screen buffer being drawn:
