I've updated the site a few times since my last front-page blog post. So what's happened lately?

* Art! The [Sunrise Set](../doodles/sunrise.html) is a collection of, presently, seven drawings of sunlit scenes in a geometric vector style. If you like them, you can download them as 1024x1024-pixel resolution PNGs.

* Wallpaper! I've added [a new page](../doodles/acorn.html) with chamfered and embossed variations on the "modern" Acorn logo. They are based on the Acorn logo I recreated for my [Risc PC in Blender](../doodles/blendrpc.html). You can download as 1920x1200-pixel resolution PNGs, or versions tuned for the Archimedes 256-colour palette at 800x600 pixels. You can grab the source files too, if you use Affinity Designer.

* Tweaks! My fantasy [Acorn branded hard disc in a diagram type style](../doodles/acornhdd.html) image thing got tweaked a bit with changed colours and other bits.

* Diagrams! At one point I was working on an article about how to properly wire up Risc PC IDE cables, but drawing a diagram of Risc PC innards ended up being more interesting. I spent some hours drawing two diagrams and never finished the article itself... The two hard disc diagrams are added to the bottom of the [hard disc page](../doodles/acornhdd.html).
