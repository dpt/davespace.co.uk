<!-- begin summary -->

[PrivateEye](/risc.os/privateeye.html) 3.01 is now available. This includes a fix for filing systems which don't provide predictable sequence numbers. Previously using Page Up or Page Down to flip between images when using a filing system such as FAT32FS could bring them up in an unexpected order. PrivateEye now rescans the directory on each flip to find the previous or next image as requested.

Since it's a minor fix I've not updated the PDF manual.
