I’ve been working on a C library called [Containers](https://github.com/dpt/Containers). This implements various different associative array structures, such as arrays, linked lists, binary search trees, tries and crit-bit trees. It’s now hosted on [github](http://github.com/).

Also, I’ve made some small-ish tweaks to the site:

* The slides on the [ARM training pages](/arm/index.html) now have a background box with rounded corners and shadows where available.
* There’s a nice new footer at the bottom of every page on the site.
