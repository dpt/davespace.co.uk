Sprites and PNGs may specify an alpha channel to hold transparency information. PrivateEye can now recognise and display these images using the [Tinct](http://tinct.net/Downloads/Tinct.aspx) module.

Transparent images can be displayed against a checkerboard pattern background.

The effect system now knows about alpha channel data and always preserves it. The curve effect has been upgraded to allow editing of the alpha data.

All these changes are mainly in aid of enhanced PNG support. Now all of the images in PngSuite can be loaded and displayed.
