Features:

* Bitmap effects
  * New bitmap effects window allows adjustment of brightness, contrast, gamma, tinting, blurring, sharpening, histogram-based adjustments and more.
* Editing awareness
  * PrivateEye now knows when youâ€™ve edited images.
* Histogram
  * The histogram window has been freed from the menu structure and can now show you the individual histograms for red, green and blue.
* PhotoCheck
  * Brought across from PhotoFiler, this OS patch enables the versions of SpriteExtend in RISC OS 3.6, 3.7 and 4.0x to cope with a greater range of JPEGs.
* Customisable keymap
  * You can now redefine or supplement the standard key mappings.
