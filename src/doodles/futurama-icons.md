Here's the most common Futurama characters drawn using the limitations of the RISC OS desktop's 16-colour icon format!

The palette becomes more restrictive for this group compared to my attempt at [The Simpsons](simpsons-icons.html): I could really do with a light pink shade in the [RISC OS desktop palette](https://lospec.com/palette-list/risc-os) to use for skin. Scruffy looks quite pale for instance. I needed to stipple blue and red to approximate Leela's purple hair.

## Update

I added more characters:

With the comments above about the limitations of the palette in mind I had a go at re-colouring and adjusting the drawing to use the [PICO-8 palette](https://lospec.com/palette-list/pico-8):

## Videos

I made a few recordings of the drawing process. Here's me drawing Leela:
