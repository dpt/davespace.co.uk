Here's the main Futurama characters drawn as RISC OS desktop icons.

The palette becomes more restrictive for this group compared to my attempt at [The Simpsons](simpsons-icons.html): I could really do with a light pink shade in the [RISC OS desktop palette](https://lospec.com/palette-list/risc-os) to use for skin. Scruffy looks quite pale for instance. I needed to stipple blue and red to approximate Leela's purple hair.

I made a few recordings of the drawing process. Here's me drawing Leela:
