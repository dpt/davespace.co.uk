This is [Sydney Savage](http://dangergirl.wikia.com/wiki/Sydney_Savage): one of the main characters from J. Scott Campbell and Andy Hartnell's [Danger Girl](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danger_Girl) comic book series.

This is my unfinished trace of the character. I was manually tracing it from a few different source images in [Xara](https://www.xara.com/us/designer-pro/). The intention with this was to get it drawn nice and detailed at A0 size then print it out for my own use as a poster. But... it became more and more complicated until I eventually just gave up on it.
