## Second attempt - 2024

My first attempt at drawing this logo (see below) used a respaced and slightly modified Gill Sans as the main text. In restrospect it looked a bit too light. Also the "i" and the "m" were a bit too close together in the result. In this version I've redrawn the whole logo from scratch.

## First attempt - 2019

I have recreated the logo from Acorn's Archimedes range of computers:

![Acorn Archimedes logo](archimedes/archimedes.png)

I traced this from a scan of the original and matched the fonts. The original seems to have marginally thicker letterforms (although that perhaps could be an artefact of the printing process) and a slightly different slope on the end of the 'r'. It's a pretty good match otherwise.

Why do this? To make custom mouse mats of course!
