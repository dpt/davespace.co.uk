I have recreated the logo from Acorn's Archimedes range of computers:

I traced this from a scan of the original and matched the fonts. The original seems to have marginally thicker letterforms (although that perhaps could be an artefact of the printing process) but it's a pretty good match otherwise.

But why? To make custom mouse mats of course!
