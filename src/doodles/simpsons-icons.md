Here's an attempt to draw the main The Simpsons characters, and a selection of the others, as RISC OS desktop icons.

Thanks to the strong yellow in the [RISC OS desktop palette](https://lospec.com/palette-list/risc-os) it suits them well, in the main. The lack of resolution affects Bart's hair though and prevents some of the more subtle shaping.

I've also attempted [Futurama](futurama-icons.html).
