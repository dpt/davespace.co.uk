[remove-duplicates.py](../software/remove-duplicates.py) is a small Python script which deletes files with the same size and MD5 checksum.

It recursively processes the specified directory and its sub-directories.

If you want to preserve certain files, you need to ensure that theyâ€™re last in the directory list.

## Example

To recursively remove all duplicate files from the current directory:

```
$ remove-duplicates.py ./photos/
```
