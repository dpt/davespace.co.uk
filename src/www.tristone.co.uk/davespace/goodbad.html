              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps you will agree. Perhaps not. Maybe the only thing of importance is that 'Snickers' really is a very silly name for a chocolate bar.

                    It's fast, easy to use, does what you would expect it to and even includes an assembler. You can write just about anything in it and the more you get to know the language, the more it makes sense.

                    It snipes and plots against you behind your back. Pretends to be object-oriented but isn't. Refuses to load files with two identically named routines. Syntax checks your half-finished lines and pops up stop-everything dialogues pointing out irrelevant errors...
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    They haven't noticed that BASIC is an acronym either.
