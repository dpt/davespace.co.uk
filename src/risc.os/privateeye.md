PrivateEye is an image viewer for RISC OS.

It requires RISC OS 3.6 or later and a Boot sequence with the Nested Wimp and a 32-bit Shared C Library.

  * DrawFiles and ArtWorks
* Bitmap effects:
  * Adjust gamma, brightness and contrast
  * Blur and sharpen
  * Change saturation and apply histogram effects
* Alpha channel support
* Bitmap rotation with interactive preview
  * Rotation is lossless for JPEGs
* Native JPEG display using SpriteExtend’s on-the-fly renderer
* Inbuilt lossless “cleaning” transparently loads progressive JPEGs
* JFIF, Exif and Adobe metadata information
* Multiple-channel histogram
* Display images may be saved:
  * Convert JPEGs, GIFs and PNGs to into Sprites
* Any number of images may be open concurrently
