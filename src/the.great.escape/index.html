<h2>Reverse Engineering The Great Escape</h2>

<p>The Great Escape is a classic 1986 prison break game for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZX_Spectrum">48K ZX Spectrum]</a>. I've spent a considerable amount of time reverse engineering its routines and documenting its workings while simultaneously reimplementing it as portable C code. The following pages describe the process I went through.</p>

<p>This is an expanded-upon write-up of some of what I can dimly recall saying while presenting <a href="http://slides.com/dpt/the-great-escape/#/">these slides</a> to my team at INSIDE Secure (formerly Metaforic, now called Verimatrix) in Glasgow at a talk in January 2016.</p>
