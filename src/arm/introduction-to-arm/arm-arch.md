## ARM Architecture

* Programming in ARM is like having a ‘big’ 6502.
  * Many familiar instructions.
  * ARM is a RISC chip: Reduced Instruction Set Computing.
* There are currently seven distinct versions of the architecture.
  * Each builds upon the previous version.
  * Architecture numbers aren’t model numbers.
  * e.g. an ARM9 chip might be ARMv4 or ARMv5.
