## Remarks

Only the newest tools currently target v7. e.g. [CodeSourceryâ€™s GCC ARM toolchain](http://www.codesourcery.com/sgpp/lite/arm).

> [NEON technology](http://www.arm.com/products/processors/technologies/neon.php) is a 64/128-bit hybrid SIMD architecture developed by ARM to accelerate the performance of multimedia and signal processing applications [...].

> The NEON architecture provides at least 3x the performance of ARMv5 and 2x the performance of ARMv6 SIMD on a range of media and DSP applications.
