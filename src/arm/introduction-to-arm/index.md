## Introduction

The *Introduction to ARM* course aims to bring the reader up-to-speed on programming in ARM assembly language. Its goal is **not** to get you to write entire programs in ARM assembly language, but instead to give you enough knowledge to make judicious use of it.

While you might never routinely come into contact with assembly language there are a number of reasons for delving down to the assembly level:

* You might want to improve the performance of speed-critical portions of your code,
* You might be debugging, trying to solve a problem which is not obvious from the source code alone,
* Or, you might just be curious.

### Limitations

The course was written with application programmers in mind, rather than systems programmers. As such the content is geared towards the ‘user mode’ world. Vectors, exceptions, interrupt and processor modes are not presently discussed.

### Further Reading

This is the first part of a two-part ARM training course, the second is called Efficient C for ARM and is available [here](http://www.davespace.co.uk/arm/efficient-c-for-arm/index.html).
