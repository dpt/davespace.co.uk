## Introduction

This course is all about tuning your code. Itâ€™s about how you can improve your C specifically for ARM CPUs so that it runs faster, takes up less space or possibly both.

After groundwork, the first half covers basic optimisations. Theoretically most of these improvements should apply to the majority of CPUs.

The second half introduces techniques which tend to rely on the specific nature of the ARM architecture to improve the code.
