## C Data Types

Certain C data types are more efficient to use for local variables than others.

* ARM has 32-bit wide registers and 32-bit data processing instructions.

Therefore the machineâ€™s natural word type, `int`, is 32-bit.

C Data Type | Implementation
------------|-----------------
`char`      | unsigned 8-bit byte
`short`     | signed 16-bit halfword
`int`       | signed 32-bit word
`long`      | signed 32-bit word
`long long` | signed 64-bit double word
