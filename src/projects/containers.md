*Containers* is a library of associative array data structures implemented as binary trees in C.

At first I was looking for a data structure which would factor out common parts of long strings (filenames). I discovered the *PATRICIA tree* and wondered if this could be made to do what I required.

Itâ€™s on [github](http://github.com/dpt/Containers).
