              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These pages were created by sweat and toil, using <a href="ftp://ftp.zap.uk.eu.org/pub/1.35/">Zap</a> and whatever browsers I've had to hand at the time. <a href="http://www.acorn.com/browser/">Browse</a> was poked with sticks when its occasionally bizarre rendering became an issue. <a href="http://www.argonet.co.uk/ant/">Fresco</a> demo went like a rocket and then blew up, like a rocket. Once <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/">Netscape</a> had eventually loaded and configured, I was too tired to continue. <a href="http://www.penthouse.com/">Internet Explorer</a> blew up before I could load it.

              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Title graphics and stick persons were created in Draw - the well known ArtWorks-beater. Sticks were rendered at high magnification using Art2Spr, then ChangeFSI'd down into a 16M colour sprite, which was then trimmed in Paint and sent through InterGif.
