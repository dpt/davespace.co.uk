sbrodie:

I read all of the first part, and most of the second part.  Excellent
slides, I thought.  In all of what I read, I didn't spot any real errors
which, given the amount of material there, is amazing.  I spotted just one
minor inefficiency (in a sample answer, a MOVEQ pc, r14 can be removed if
you make the next instruction SUBNES) and one bit of implementation-defined
C that wasn't noted as such (right shift of signed int).
