    <h1>ARM Training</h1>
    <div id="bgtop"></div>

    <div class="slide">
      <p>Here are two courses written to introduce my former colleagues at <a
        class="external" href="http://www.picsel.com/">Picsel Technologies</a>
      to the joys of programming in <a class="external"
        href="http://www.arm.com/">ARM assembly language</a>.</p>
      <dl>
        <dt><a href="introduction-to-arm/index.html">Introduction to ARM</a></dt>
        <dd>The first course introduces the reader to ARM assembly
        language. It goes on to explain the development of the ARM architecture and
        the capabilities of the various ARM CPU cores.</dd>
        <dd>After reading this you should be able to understand ARM code well
        enough to understand the examples in the next course...</dd>
        <dt><a href="efficient-c-for-arm/index.html">Efficient C for ARM</a></dt>
        <dd>The second course is about tuning. It looks at how we can produce
        efficient ARM code by altering the way we write our C code.</dd>
      </dl>
      <p>The courses were presented to over 70 engineers in Glasgow, Edinburgh,
      Reading, Malaysia and Korea.</p>
      <p>When delivered, each course would usually take three hours to run
      through. The course would be presented sandwich style: two lecture parts
      and a delicious centre filling where the student gets to experiment with
      some small routines.</p>
    </div>
    <h2>Caveats</h2>
    <div class="slide">
      <p>The courses were manually converted across from the PowerPoint slides
      and separate trainer's notes I used when presenting the courses. This may
      show in the terseness of some of the pages.  Some detail is sacrificed
      for the sake of making a point.</p>
      <p>Some closely related sections have been merged together, some were
      left separate. Some pages are of substantially different lengths.</p>
      <p>Over time I'll rework the content to better suit its new format.</p>
      <p>The courses were written for an environment where ARM Developer Suite
      (ADS) was available, so all of the assembler examples are in ADS format.
      If you intend to try the examples on a more affordable compiler, such as
      <a class="external" href="http://gcc.gnu.org/">GCC</a>, you will need to
      use <a class="external" href="http://microcross.com/GNU-ARM-Assy-Quick-Ref.pdf">GNU ARM assembler
        syntax</a>.</p>
      <p>Assembler examples were compiled with ADS 1.2's armcc and GCC 2.95.
      You will find that other compilers produce different code, of varying
      quality.</p>
